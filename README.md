# ECEC-680-Project
Early Stage Embryo Development based Prediction
The idea of the project is to compare the features in early stage embryo division and obtain the eﬀect of those diﬀerent information on later development. Even though the embryo division happens in similar pattern, there can be still diﬀerences between diﬀerent embryos. These features can be division time, relative size and shape, the clearness of embryos and so on. The diﬀerence in features could potentially aﬀect the growth of embryos and by studying and analyzing them, the development can be predicted.
